Zenesis is a schema-based code generator for TypeScript type definitions. It lets you construct types through code without having to work with ASTs, writing text templates, or anything like that.

Zenesis uses a schema-based approach instead, taking heavy inspiration from Zod, a TypeScript data validation library.

Instead, you construc
t types in the same way you'd construct Zod schemas, while also being able to reference other types, including types you're constructing as well as external types.
